        <td>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.</td>
        <td>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and final major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>The most basic way of adding text to a web page is the paragraph element. If you've been following along with this tutorial, you've seen this element before, but it's worth repeating, because the paragraph element is one of the most common HTML elements used on most of the websites you visit every day. </td>
        <td>Despite this concept of a "living standard," the current specifications are still mostly thought of as HTML5. Although the "5" has been dropped from the official name, there's a general perception that the current HTML version, which followed HTML4, is for all practical purposes HTML5. When the newer version was first introduced, it was officially referred to HTML5, and that label has stuck throughout its history. It is this version that gave rise to the modern web as we know it today.</td>
